This project was developed as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course. 
The software was created by Tommaso Bandini, Tommaso Goni, Claudio Lodi, and Luigi Linari.

## Download
The game is distributed as a runnable JAR file, available both in the project root 
and in the Releases section. 
Java 21 or higher is required to run it.

## User guide
To play the game, only the mouse is required. Towers can be placed by clicking on 
the signs and confirming the purchase in the corresponding window. 
Clicking on a tower opens its menu, which can be closed by clicking outside of it.
Within the menu, targeting priorities can be changed and upgrades or resets can be 
applied with a single click. All changes are clearly displayed in the towerâ€™s interface. 
By hovering over an upgrade or reset button, the impact of the change is shown in real 
time before confirmation. To save in-game go to Options and click Menu.
